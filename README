   oscenum is a small tool for querying liblo-based
   OSC servers about their registered methods.

   you need liblo installed to compile it.

   build it like this:
   
       $ make
	   gcc oscenum.c -llo -o oscenum

   use it like this:

       $ ./oscenum localhost 19094 /monome
       /monome/grid
       /monome/ring
       /monome/tilt

   pretty cool! also included is osctree, a shell script
   for querying all of the sub-paths of an oscenum call.

       $ ./osctree localhost 19094 /monome
       /monome/grid/led/set
       /monome/grid/led/all
       /monome/grid/led/map
       /monome/grid/led/col
       /monome/grid/led/row
       /monome/grid/led/intensity
       /monome/grid/led/level/set
       /monome/grid/led/level/all
       /monome/grid/led/level/map
       /monome/grid/led/level/col
       /monome/grid/led/level/row
       /monome/ring/set
       /monome/ring/all
       /monome/ring/map
       /monome/ring/range
       /monome/tilt/set

   dang, cuz.

   as far as i know, this is functionality that is only
   supported by liblo servers using the built-in
   lo_server_add_method() call for dispatching OSC paths.

   under the hood deets:
   sending a liblo server an OSC message with a trailing
   slash (like "/monome/") will generate a "#reply" message
   with all of the sub-paths attached as string arguments.

   so, for example, the above ./oscenum /monome call results
   in a message like "#reply ssss /monome grid ring tilt".

   the reason we need a custom program to send this is
   because the initial enumeration call must be sent from
   the port at which the #reply is to be received. liblo
   makes this easy and i know the API pretty well so this
   was a quick hack.

   you'll note that we don't get the typetag signatures for
   the methods, which is a pity. still, partial introspection
   is better than no introspection.
